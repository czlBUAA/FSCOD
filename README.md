The FSCOD is the first dataset simulating failed spacecraft relative motion. It consists of training an validation sets and test sets.  More details can found in my ASR paper. Note that Perturbative forces and moments is not considered in uploaded file. SDPED that considers perturbation will be available soon. SDPED without perturbative forces and moments can be downloaded in https://bhpan.buaa.edu.cn/link/AA423F3CB23C9E4C3FBC8F7CBF4474694B
